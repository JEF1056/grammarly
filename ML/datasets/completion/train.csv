"complete: First of all, the population of the world",is declining.

"complete: Next, kids are",more attracted to advertisements.

"complete: When you understand the concepts and ideas, it is up to you to prove them and to see if they are really what you have been told, and I think this is the main reason that students",prefer facts rather than understanding ideas and concepts.
"complete: For example, if you are","attempting to study arts and sciences and attain qualifications in both, you are an extraordinary student."

"complete: Of course, things",are new and very risky.
"complete: For example, little children are told to not","cross the street at a red light, because it is too dangerous and we cannot let kids learn from a crash."

"complete: If I want to win a case in court,","for example, a case where technical questions are to be considered, it is not enough to just know about the law."
"complete: Second, is there",any problem with the goods.
"complete: Some people might say,"" hey how does energy","form""."

"complete: First of all, the population",of the world is going down.
complete: My wife,and I always go to Tokyo around December.
"complete: Thereby the problem of running out of fuel is out of the question, hence",augmenting my view that the number of cars will continue to rise and not decline.

complete: Raising taxes for the gas can be the most effective and possible way to decrease the use of gas because,of three reasons.
"complete: Next, kids are more attracted",to the advertisements.

complete: I think that it is not always fair because not all the students work in the same way and with,the same responsibility.
"complete: Of course, things",are new and very risky.
"complete: For example, little children are told to not cross the street at a red light, because it",is so dangerous that we cannot let kids learn from a potential crash.
"complete: In my opinion, students need",some knowledge.
complete: So because more people are able to buy cars the demand for cars will increase and so the production of cars,will also increase and in the end this means that the number of cars will increase from now to twenty years time.
"complete: First, they have spend a lot of time","on the computer, so they don't know how to communicate."

"complete: We know that prescribed burning should be repeated every few years, but it's",very expensive to spend every few years.
"complete: Second, the difference between the encyclopedia is that there a lot of viruses and hackers on the internet and one of",the hackers could easily change the information about any topic.
"complete: If I want to win a case in court,","for example, a case where technical questions are to be considered, it is not enough to just know about the law."
"complete: Second, if there are any problems with",the goods.
"complete: Some people might say,"" Hey, how","does energy come?"""
complete: The successful people try to do new things like,any machine can help the people.
"complete: However, the problem is how long will it take us to find out that we are actually controlled by the advertisements",and the perfect image they gave us?
complete: Consumers are not likely to buy a pair of trousers when the claim is that they will increase the,capacity to fly.
